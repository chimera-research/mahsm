   ‚Üí Data: Optimized prompts, tool schemas, message histories, configuration
   ‚Üí Constraints: No LangChain lock-in, transparency, traceability
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All core aspects clearly defined in input
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear workflow: offline optimization ‚Üí save ‚Üí load ‚Üí runtime execution
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement derived from specified primitives and workflow
6. Identify Key Entities

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a data scientist, I want to optimize prompts offline using DSPy and then seamlessly use those optimized prompts in production LangGraph agents with full transparency and traceability, so that I can maintain clean separation between optimization and runtime while ensuring complete visibility into agent conversations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have run DSPy GEPA optimizer and have an optimized program, **When** I save the optimized prompt with associated tools, **Then** the system creates a JSON artifact containing the prompt string, tool schemas, and metadata
2. **Given** I have a saved prompt artifact, **When** I load it in a LangGraph node with matching tools, **Then** the system validates tool compatibility and returns the prompt string
3. **Given** I have a loaded prompt and tools, **When** I execute inference with user input, **Then** the system creates a complete message history with SystemMessage, HumanMessage, AIMessages, and ToolMessages in correct order
4. **Given** inference is running with tool calls, **When** tools are executed, **Then** each tool execution result is wrapped in a ToolMessage and appended to the conversation state
5. **Given** I want to trace agent behavior, **When** I inspect the conversation state, **Then** I can see the complete transparent record of all interactions including the original DSPy prompt

### Edge Cases
- What happens when loaded tools don't match saved tool schemas?
- How does system handle tool execution errors during inference?
- What occurs when maximum iterations are reached during agentic loop?
- How are non-JSON serializable inputs handled?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide ma.prompt.save() to extract optimized prompt strings from DSPy compiled programs and store them with tool schemas in JSON artifacts
- **FR-002**: System MUST store prompt artifacts in ~/.mahsm/prompts/ directory with naming convention task_name_version.json
- **FR-003**: System MUST include tool schemas in OpenAI function calling format within prompt artifacts for validation
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide ma.prompt.load() to retrieve saved prompts and validate tool compatibility
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate that runtime tools match saved tool schemas by comparing names and parameter structures
- **FR-006**: System MUST raise ValidationError with clear messages when tool validation fails
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide ma.inference() to execute prompts with tools in an agentic loop
- **FR-008**: System MUST create SystemMessage from loaded prompt and HumanMessage from user input
- **FR-009**: System MUST execute tools as Python functions and wrap results in ToolMessage instances
- **FR-010**: System MUST append all messages to state in correct order: SystemMessage, HumanMessage, then AIMessage/ToolMessage pairs
- **FR-011**: System MUST continue agentic loop until AIMessage has no tool_calls or max_iterations reached
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle tool execution errors by wrapping them in ToolExecutionError
- **FR-013**: System MUST raise MaxIterationsError when loop exceeds max_iterations parameter
- **FR-014**: System MUST return tuple of (final_result, messages_list) from ma.inference()
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide global ma.config object for environment variable configuration
- **FR-016**: System MUST support automatic LangFuse tracing when LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY and LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY are configured
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide get_checkpointer() method for LangGraph-compatible storage options
- **FR-018**: System MUST use only LangChain message types without other LangChain dependencies
- **FR-019**: System MUST handle dict, string, and JSON-serializable inputs by converting to HumanMessage content
- **FR-020**: System MUST provide comprehensive type hints, docstrings, and error messages

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Prompt Artifact**: JSON file containing optimized prompt string, tool schemas in OpenAI format, optimizer metadata, and creation timestamp
- **Tool Schema**: OpenAI function calling format specification including tool name and parameter structure for validation
- **Message State**: LangGraph-compatible state object containing ordered sequence of SystemMessage, HumanMessage, AIMessage, and ToolMessage instances
- **Configuration**: Global settings object managing environment variables for tracing and checkpointer options
