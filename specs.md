Develop MAHSM (Multi-Agent Hyper-Scaling Methods) v0.1.0, a Python library that connects DSPy prompt optimization with LangGraph runtime orchestration without lock-in to the LangChain ecosystem. The core problem: data scientists optimize prompts offline using DSPy's GEPA or other optimizers, but then need to use those optimized prompts in production LangGraph agents with full transparency and traceability. MAHSM provides three primitives that maintain a clean message-based state architecture. Here's the workflow: During offline optimization, a user runs DSPy's GEPA optimizer which produces an optimized prompt string accessible via optimized_program.predict.signature.instructions. They then call ma.prompt.save(compiled_agent, name="task_name", version="v1", tools=[tool1, tool2]) which extracts this prompt string and stores it in a JSON artifact at ~/.mahsm/prompts/task_name_v1.json. The JSON artifact contains the prompt as a string field, plus tool schemas in OpenAI function calling format for validation, plus metadata about the optimizer and creation time. The prompt itself remains as markdown/text, but the container is JSON to enable programmatic tool schema validation. Later at runtime, inside a LangGraph node function, they call prompt = ma.prompt.load("task_name_v1", validate_tools=[tool1, tool2]) which loads the artifact, validates that the provided tools match the saved tool schemas by comparing name and parameter structure using OpenAI function schema format, and returns just the prompt string. Then they call result = ma.inference(model="openai/gpt-4o-mini", prompt=prompt, tools=[tool1, tool2], input=user_query, state=state) which executes the following: it takes the prompt and creates a SystemMessage, takes the input and creates a HumanMessage, invokes the model which returns an AIMessage potentially with tool_calls, if tool_calls exist it executes each tool and creates ToolMessages with the results, appends all messages to the state in order, loops back to invoke the model again with the full message history, continues until the AIMessage has no tool_calls or max_iterations is reached, and returns the final result. Critically, ma.inference() must append every single message to the state object in the correct order: SystemMessage first, then HumanMessage, then each AIMessage and its corresponding ToolMessages in sequence as the agentic loop executes. The state object (a MessagesState with the add_messages reducer is the default) at its simplest is just a list or dict containing messages key with SystemMessage, HumanMessage, AIMessage, and ToolMessage instances from langchain_core.messages. This is the only dependency on LangChain - we use their message types because they are the standard for LangGraph state, and this ensures that when a human or AI inspects the state via LangFuse traces, they see a complete transparent record of the DSPy compiled prompt as SystemMessage, the user input as HumanMessage, all model responses as AIMessages with tool_calls parsed out, and all tool executions as ToolMessages. The ma.inference() function should NOT use LangChain's tool binding or execution beyond the message types - it should directly call tools as Python functions and format results into ToolMessages. This should be done using the ToolNode-style of logic internally; additional inspiration and source code can come from the smolagents library. Tool validation happens by comparing the OpenAI function schema format: tool name must match exactly, and parameter schema must match structurally. If tools don't match during ma.prompt.load(), raise ValidationError with clear message about which tool is missing or mismatched. The ma.inference() function must handle dict, string, and JSON-serializable inputs by converting them to HumanMessage content, execute tools by calling them as regular Python functions (ToolNode; smolagents) and wrapping results in ToolMessage instances, catch tool execution errors and wrap them in ToolExecutionError, raise MaxIterationsError if loop exceeds max_iterations parameter, and return a tuple of (final_result, messages_list) so users can inspect the full conversation. Configuration is managed through a global ma.config object that auto-loads from environment variables including LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY and LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY for automatic tracing of all ma.inference() calls, and provides get_checkpointer() method that returns LangGraph-compatible checkpointers for SQLite, Postgres, or in-memory storage. As of v0.1.0, this is a minimal helper library, not a framework - users write their own DSPy optimization scripts and LangGraph graphs, MAHSM just provides the clean bridge between them with full message transparency. No high-level agent classes, no optimizer wrappers, no graph builders, no LangChain tool binding beyond message types. The success criteria: a user can run GEPA optimization, extract the optimized prompt string, save it with tool schemas in JSON, load it in a LangGraph node with validation, run ma.inference() which populates state with clean message sequences, inspect the full SystemMessage-HumanMessage-AIMessage-ToolMessage conversation in LangFuse traces, and everything has fantastic autocompletions, type hints, docstrings, comprehensive tests, stellar documentation, and clear error messages when validation fails.
