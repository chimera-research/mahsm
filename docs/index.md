# mahsm: A Declarative Framework for Building Production-Grade AI Systems

**mahsm (Multi-Agent Hyper-Scaling Methods)** is a unified, declarative framework designed to streamline the entire lifecycle of building, observing, and evaluating sophisticated multi-agent AI systems.

It addresses the core challenge in modern AI development: the immense boilerplate and friction involved in wiring together state-of-the-art tools for reasoning, orchestration, tracing, and testing.

By providing a cohesive, high-level API, `mahsm` allows developers to focus on the **logic** of their agents, not the plumbing. The result is a development workflow that is faster, more robust, and produces systems that are observable and testable by default.

### Key Features

*   **Declarative by Design:** Say goodbye to glue code. Declare your system's components, and `mahsm` handles the integration.
*   **Best-in-Class Tooling:** A seamless fusion of **DSPy**, **LangGraph**, **LangFuse**, and **EvalProtocol**.
*   **Zero-Effort Observability:** Get deep, hierarchical traces automatically with a single line of code.
*   **Testable by Default:** A built-in testing harness makes evaluating your agents a first-class citizen of the development process.
